# Mimasa - EmoteTrans [A Real-time Multilingual Face Translator] [![Build Github Pages](https://github.com/developers-cosmos/Mimasa/actions/workflows/pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/developers-cosmos/Mimasa/actions/workflows/pages.yml)

## Overview

The idea behind Mimasa is to provide a seamless translation experience for people who are communicating with individuals who speak different languages. The application uses advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and track the facial movements and speech of a person in real-time, and then uses natural language processing (NLP) to translate the speech to another language. The output audio is then synced with the facial movements of the person to provide a more natural and realistic translation experience. Additionally, Mimasa can also separate the music and speech from the video input, which allows for a more accurate translation experience. Overall, Mimasa aims to bridge the language barrier and make communication between people of different languages easier and more efficient.
